Title: Desktop Theme

Summary: New desktop theme.

I just ordered a new mechanical keyboard, and it has inspired me to really work on improving the theme of my workspace.

Here is what I've started. I like the color palette a lot; now it's just begging for a nice, tiling window manager and to get rid of those thick borders/titles.

More to come once I get the WM installed.
